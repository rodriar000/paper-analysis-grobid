paper6.pdf,Entanglement dynamics of many-body quantum states with evolving system conditions,"The entanglement analysis of a pure state of a many-body quantum system requires a prior information about its density matrix/ state matrix, obtained in principle by solving the Hamiltonian matrix. The missing information due to complexity of the many-body interactions however renders it necessary to consider an ensemble of Hamiltonians and thereby an ensemble of pure states. This in turn leaves a statistical description of the entanglement measures as the only option. We consider physical Hamiltonians that can be modelled by a multiparametric Gaussian ensembles, theoretically derive the state ensembles for its eigenstates and analyze the effect of varying system conditions on its entanglement statistics. Our approach leads to a single parametric based common mathematical formulation for the evolution of the statistics of different state ensembles. The parameter turns out to be a single functional of the system parameters and thereby reveals a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.",18,
paper7.pdf,POLYNOMIAL TODA MAPS ARE TRANSFER MATRICES,"We consider entire matrix functions A(z) taking values in SL(2, C). These map pairs of Herglotz functions by acting pointwise as linear fractional transformations. The main examples of such Toda maps are provided by transfer matrices of differential and difference operators and by the cocycles associated with the classical integrable systems (Toda, KdV, etc.) on these operators. Here we consider polynomial matrix functions A(z). We describe these in terms of a factorization, and we then prove that if A induces a Toda map, then A is essentially a transfer matrix.",4,
paper10.pdf,LINEAR INSTABILITY OF THE PRANDTL EQUATIONS VIA HYPERGEOMETRIC FUNCTIONS AND THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR,"We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schrödinger operator. Our first result concerns an ODE and a spectral condition derived in [10], associated with unstable quasieigenmodes of the Prandtl equations. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. By classifying their asymptotic behaviour, we verify that the spectral condition has a unique, explicitly determined pair of eigenvalue and eigenfunction, the latter being expressible as a combination of elementary functions. Secondly, we prove that any quasi-eigenmode solution of the linearised Prandtl equations around a quadratic shear flow can be explicitly determined from algebraic eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger operator with quadratic potential. We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature.",30,
paper5.pdf,Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees,"Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.",7,
paper4.pdf,"Sasaki-Einstein Geometry, GK Geometry and the AdS/CFT correspondence","We review various aspects of Sasaki-Einstein and GK geometry, emphasising their similarities, interconnections and significance for the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, we highlight the key role that physical considerations have played in formulating geometric extremization principles, which have been instrumental in both understanding the geometry and identifying the corresponding dual field theories.

paper1.pdf,Charges in light cones and quenched infrared radiation,"The creation of electrically charged states and the resulting electromagnetic fields are considered in space-time regions in which such experiments can actually be carried out, namely in future-directed light cones. Under the simplifying assumption of external charges, charged states are formed from neutral pairs of opposite charges, with one charge being shifted to light-like infinity. It thereby escapes observation. Despite the fact that this charge moves asymptotically at the speed of light, the resulting electromagnetic field has a well-defined energy operator that is bounded from below. Moreover, due to the spatiotemporal restrictions, the transverse electromagnetic field (the radiation) has no infrared singularities in the light cone. They are quenched and the observed radiation can be described by states in the Fock space of photons. The longitudinal field between the charges (giving rise to Gauss's law) disappears for inertial observers in an instant. This is consistent with the fact that there is no evidence for the existence of longitudinal photons. The results show that the restrictions of operations and observations to light cones, which are dictated by the arrow of time, amount to a Lorentz-invariant infrared cutoff.",8,
paper3.pdf,THE STRUCTURES OF SIMPLE HURWITZ NUMBERS AND MONOTONE HURWITZ NUMBERS WITH VARYING GENUS,"We study the structures of ordinary simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus. More precisely, we prove that when the ramification type is fixed and the genus is treated as a variable, the connected monotone Hurwitz number is a linear combination of products of exponentials and polynomials, and the ordinary simple Hurwitz number is a linear combination of exponentials. Using these structural properties, we also derive the large genus asymptotics of these two kinds of Hurwitz numbers. As a result, we prove one conjecture, and disprove another, both proposed by Do, He and Robertson.",9,

paper8.pdf,"Streams, Graphs and Global Attractors of Dynamical Systems on Locally Compact Spaces","In a recent article, we introduced the concept of streams and graphs of a semiflow. An important related concept is the one of semiflow with compact dynamics, which we defined as a semiflow F with a compact global trapping region. In this follow-up, we restrict to the important case where the phase space X is locally compact and we move the focus on the concept of global attractor, a maximal compact set that attracts every compact subset of X. A semiflow F can have many global trapping regions but, if it has a global attractor, this is unique. We modify here our original definition and we say that F has compact dynamics if it has a global attractor G. We show that most of the qualitative properties of F are inherited by the restriction F G of F to G and that, in case of Conley's chains stream of F , the qualitative 1",23,
