<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We consider in this article the construction of electrically charged states in light cones from neutral pairs of opposite charges. This is accomplished by transporting one of the charges to light-like infinity. It thereby disappears in the space-like complement of any observer in the cone, leaving behind the other charge, whence a charged state. Such a construction of charged states was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> in order to avoid the well known infrared problems appearing in Minkowski space theories. It takes into account the fact that observations are only possible in future directed light cones, they are impossible in the past. More precisely, they cannot be made up for by returning to the past. This basic fact implies that a resolution of the infrared properties of radiation, predicted by the theory, is beyond the limits of any experiment.</p><p>To simplify the analysis, we restrict our attention to external charges that act on the electromagnetic field but are not influenced by it. In this framework, we determine the energetic properties of the field generated by the transport of a charge in a given pair to light-like infinity. Even though this charge moves asymptotically at the speed of light, the resulting field induces representations of the observables in which the spacetime translations are unitarily implemented and fulfill the relativistic spectrum condition. Moreover, the subalgebras of the observables in light cones are normal with respect to the vacuum (Fock) representation, i.e. the clouds of photons created by this procedure do not appear as superselected. These observations complement and enhance related results of Cadamuro and Dybalski <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Furthermore, the longitudinal photons that form the gauge bridges between charges disappear in an instant and are virtual in this sense. Our results confirm the ideas on which the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> is based. They show that the restriction of operations and observations to light cones acts like a Lorentz-invariant infrared cutoff.</p><p>We adopt in the present analysis the framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, where infrared singular charged states were constructed in Minkowski space. These were obtained by shifting in neutral pairs of opposite charges one of the charges to space-like infinity. This approach is based on a concrete version of the universal C*-algebra of the electromagnetic field, presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The external charges are described by outer automorphisms, which are implemented by unitary operators in an extended Gupta-Bleuler framework. For the validity of Gauss's law, the gauge fields in that setting are decisive. They provide information about the value of electrical charges based on flux measurements of the electromagnetic field. Whereas the impact of the charges on the electromagnetic field can be studied in that framework, it does not allow to describe the effects of changes of their location. This location is encoded in gauge bridges between the charges formed by the gauge fields. The algebra of the electromagnetic field was therefore extended by them in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>; they are complementary to the local charge operators. This extended framework provided in addition to the radiation also information about the energy contained in the gauge bridges.</p><p>In the present article, we consider both approaches, but restrict the algebras to light cones. We will show that this restriction cures the infrared problems in the Minkowskian world. The radiation produced by the creation and transport of electric charges in light cones can be described by photons in Fock space. Longitudinal photons entering the gauge bridges disappear rapidly and have little effect on inertial observers. So the notorious infrared problems in quantum electrodynamics have their origin in the assumption that observations take place in entire Minkowski space. Under the present assumptions about the spacetime location of real experiments these problems disappear.</p><p>Our article is organized as follows. We briefly summarize in Sect. 2 our algebraic framework and the description of charge-carrying automorphisms, expounded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Section 3 contains the discussion of the radiation field in light cones which arises by shifting charges to light-like infinity. We explain our arguments and present our results there. The analysis of the gauge bridges, appearing in the extended algebra, and the presentation of the corresponding results is the subject of Sect. 4. Most proofs of our statements are given in appendices. The article ends with some brief comments on the physical implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Fields and charge creating automorphisms</head><p>We use a slight generalization of the Gupta-Bleuler description of local vector potentials underlying the electromagnetic field, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. It includes, both, the observable electromagnetic field and the gauge fields that mediate the presence of charges (gauge bridges). Let D 1 (R 4 ) be the space of real, vector-valued test functions with compact support. The exponentials of the Gupta-Bleuler fields are denoted by the symbols</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e icA(f ) , c ∈ R , f ∈ D 1 (R 4 ) .</formula><p>(2.1)</p><p>These symbols generate a group with an involutive anti-automorphism * (hermitian conjugation). It is fixed by the Weyl relations, f, g ∈ D 1 (R 4 ), e iA(g) e icA(f ) = e i (c/2) g,Df e iA(g+cf ) , e iA(f ) * = e −iA(f ) , e iA(0</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">) = 1 . (2.2) Here g, Df := dxdy g µ (x) D(x − y) f µ (y) ,<label>(2.3)</label></formula><p>where D denotes the massless Pauli-Jordan commutator function. Note that we do not assume that the vector potential is a solution of the wave equation. But according to the defining equations (2.2), the exponentials e iA( f ) are elements of the center of the group, where denotes the d'Alembertian.</p><p>This group can be extended by a standard procedure to a C*-algebra W, where the exponential functions of the vector potential are represented by unitary operators, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The algebra W is the inductive limit of the family (net) of local subalgebras W(O) which are assigned to the open, bounded regions O ⊂ R 4 . Each W(O) is generated by unitaries e iA(f ) with test functions f having support in O . On this net acts the proper orthochronous Poincaré group L + ⋊ R 4 by automorphisms which induce on the test functions f entering in the generating unitaries the maps</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">((Λ, x)f )(y) := (Λ −1 f )(Λ −1 y − x) , Λ ∈ L + , x, y ∈ R 4 .</formula><p>(2.4)</p><p>One thereby arrives at a local, covariant net of C*-algebras on Minkowski space.</p><p>The electromagnetic field F is represented by a subalgebra V ⊂ W, which is an example of the universal algebra considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Since F = dA (curl of A), it follows from Poincaré's Lemma that V is generated by the unitaries e iA(h) , where h are elements of the subspace C 1 (R 4 ) ⊂ D 1 (R 4 ) of functions with vanishing divergence, δh = 0. The field F satisfies by construction the homogeneous Maxwell equations and the divergence of its Hodge dual, given by δdA, enters the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation. There it is equated with the electric current, δdA = J , which is sensitive to the charge distributions. It follows from equation (2.2) that the unitaries e iJ(f ) , f ∈ D 1 (R 4 ), are elements of the center of V. This fits with the present discussion of external charges, which are not affected by the radiation field. The subgroup generated by the radiation field can thus be identified with the unitaries e iA(h) , h ∈ C 1 (R 4 ), modulo the center originating from the current.</p><p>As is explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, external charge distributions, fixed by some signed measure δm, are described by outer automorphisms β m of the observable algebra V. They act on the generating unitaries according to β m (e iA(h) ) := e iϕm(h) e iA(h) , h ∈ C 1 (R 4 ) , <ref type="bibr">(2.5)</ref> where ϕ m is a real linear functional. We consider here functionals on D 1 (R 4 ) of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ϕ m (f ) := − dxdy m µ (x)D(x − y)f µ (y) , m ∈ D 1 (R 4 ) . (2.6)</formula><p>The automorphisms β m are then given by the adjoint action of unitary operators in W, β m (e iA(h) ) = e iA(m) e iA(h) e −iA(m) .</p><p>(2.7)</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> the unitaries e iA(m) were multiplied with unitary operators, carrying an external charge, so that the resulting operators become gauge invariant. Since these charged operators do not affect (commute with) the observables in V, we can ignore them here.</p><p>Evaluating the action of the automorphisms on the currents one obtains</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">β m (e iJ(f ) ) = e iϕm(δdf ) e iJ(f ) , f ∈ D 1 (R 4 ) . (2.8)</formula><p>It follows from equation <ref type="bibr">(2.6</ref>) that this action differs from the identity mapping if and only if δm = 0. Since the spacetime integrals of the test functions δm vanish, the total charge transferred by these automorphisms is zero, however.</p><p>In order to arrive at automorphisms that transfer a non-trivial charge one has to consider bi-localized charge distributions, where the charge has some given non-zero value in a fixed region and the opposite value in a space-like separated region. The location of charges can precisely be determined by the electromagnetic field F , making use of Gauss' law. Automorphisms that transfer a total charge different from zero are obtained by shifting the compensating charge out of reach for possible observers. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> they were shifted to space-like infinity. In the present article, where we consider observers in light cones, they are moved to light-like infinity. The resulting automorphisms are then no longer represented by the adjoint action of unitary operators in W and one must determine their limits. This is accomplished by a study of the limits of the underlying functionals ϕ m .</p><p>Turning to the expectation functionals on the algebra of observables V, we proceed from the vacuum state ω 0 that is fixed by ω 0 (e iA(h) ) := e (1/2) h,D + h , h ∈ C 1 (R 4 ) .</p><p>(2.9)</p><p>The exponent is defined by equation <ref type="bibr">(2.3)</ref>, where the Pauli-Jordan commutator function D is replaced by its positive frequency part D + . By the GNS-construction one obtains from the vacuum state the familiar representation of the electromagnetic field on Fock space, where the current vanishes, the Poincaré transformations are unitarily implemented, and the energy is non-negative for all inertial observers.</p><p>States ω m with a non-trivial charge distribution δm arise by composing the vacuum state with the corresponding automorphisms, ω m := ω 0 β m . They are pure states on V, such as the vacuum ω 0 . Since the current vanishes in the vacuum representation, the representations induced by ω m are disjoint from the vacuum representation if δm = 0. It is also clear that the spacetime translations cannot be unitarily implemented in the resulting representations, because the translations act non-trivially on the current and change the expectation values of δm, whence the representation. Nevertheless, one can determine the energetic effects of the charge distributions on the electromagnetic field. There are two issues, discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which we also address here:</p><p>(I) Focusing on the energy of the radiation field, one has to analyze the action of the automorphisms β m on the energy density of the electromagnetic field in the vacuum representation. If m ∈ D 1 (R 4 ), the generators H m , obtained by integrating the resulting densities over a Cauchy surface, are selfadjoint operators in the vacuum Fock space. In the corresponding rest frame, they are given by the action of β m ⊥ := Ad e iA(m ⊥ ) on the vacuum Hamiltonian H 0 , where m ⊥ := (0, m − ∇∆ −1 (∇m)) ∈ C 1 (R 4 ) is the transverse part of the spatial components of m, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sect. 4]</ref>. With this input, the transition to charged automorphisms and their impact on the radiation field can then be studied. To do this, the properties of the automorphisms β m ⊥ must be controlled in the limit in which the compensating charges are moved away. The results enter in the analysis of the energetic and normality properties of the limit of the states ω m ⊥ = ω 0 β m ⊥ . As an aside, the Lorentz transformations are spontaneously broken in these states in Minkowski space, so that the specification of a rest system is indicated.</p><p>(II) In order to obtain information about the energetic properties of the gauge bridges that mediate Gauss's law, the algebra V must be extended, cf. the discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">Sect. 3]</ref>. One chooses again a rest frame and considers the subalgebra V V V ⊂ W which is generated by the three spatial components A of the vector potential (temporal gauge <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). This subalgebra is also generated by a net of local algebras on which the spacetime translations act covariantly, but not the Lorentz transformations. The vacuum state is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ω 0 (e iA(g) ) := e (1/2) g,D + g , g ∈ D D D 1 (R 4 ) ,<label>(2.10)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">D D D 1 (R 4 ) ⊂ D 1 (R 4</formula><p>) is the subspace of test functions with vanishing time component. One can recover in the corresponding representation the observable algebra V by identifying the electric field with the time derivativeȦ and the magnetic field with the curl ∇ × A. Local charge distributions, determined by m ∈ D 1 (R 4 ), are created by automorphisms β n−m of V V V, where n := ∇∆ −1 ∂ 0 m 0 . These automorphisms are unitarily implemented in the vacuum representation of V V V,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">β n−m (e iA(g) ) = e iϕ n−m (g) e iA(g) = e iA(n−m) e iA(g) e −iA(n−m) , g ∈ D D D 1 (R 4 ) . (2.11)</formula><p>Just as in approach (I), one considers the automorphisms β n−m in the limit in which the compensating charge is moved away. Their analysis provides the information about the energetic and normality properties of the (charged) limits of the states ω 0 β n−m .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Charges and radiation fields in light cones</head><p>We restrict now the observables to a forward light cone, where we choose without loss of generality the open cone V + := {x ∈ R 4 : x 0 &gt; |x|} with apex at the origin 0. The corresponding subalgebra of observables is denoted by V(V + ). For the construction of bi-localized, overall neutral charge distributions m with support in V + , we consider the bijective map ξ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">R + × R 3 → V + , given by ξ(τ, x) := ( τ 2 + x 2 , x) , τ &gt; 0 , x ∈ R 3 .

(3.2)</formula><p>Singular functions (distributions) m that enter in the vector potential between opposite charges, localized at points x 1 , x 2 ∈ V + on a time shell τ , are defined as follows.

(3.5)</formula><p>We proceed from the singular functions m x 1 ,x 2 to elements of D 1 (R 4 ) by integration with suitable test functions, depending on x 1 , x 2 . With reference to their pre-images, we choose test functions of the specific form</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">(τ, x 1 , x 2 ) → ϑ(τ, x 1 )σ(x 2 − x 1 ) , (3.6)</formula><p>where ϑ has compact support in {(τ, x) : τ &gt; 0 , x ∈ R 3 } and σ has compact support in R 3 .

Since x → √ x 2 is positive on V + and smooth, it follows that m 1 ∈ D 1 (R 4 ). Moreover, relations (3.5) and (3.8) imply that</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">x → δm 1 (x) = ∂ µ m µ 1 (x) = θ(x 0 )(x 0 / √ x 2 ) ϑ( √ x 2 , x) − (ϑ ⋆ σ)( √ x 2 , x) , (3.10)</formula><p>where ϑ ⋆ σ denotes convolution of the functions with regard to the spatial variables.</p><p>In order to keep our discussion simple, we restrict our attention to functions ϑ of the product form τ, x → ϑ(τ, x) := ϑ 0 (τ )ϑ 1 (x) , (3.11)</p><p>where ϑ 0 has support in {τ ∈ R : 0 &lt; τ 1 ≤ τ ≤ τ 2 } and ϑ 1 in {x ∈ R 3 : |x| ≤ r}. For σ we choose functions which have support in {x ∈ R 3 : 0 &lt; R ≤ |x| ≤R}. It then follows after a moments reflection that the supports of the two charge densities on the right hand side of equation (3.10) are space-like separated if R &gt; (τ 2 2 − τ 2 1 )/2τ 1 + (1 + τ 2 2 /τ 2 1 ) r . We will stick in the following to functions with this product form and these support properties.</p><p>The field created by pairs of opposite charges in V + perturbs the electromagnetic field. As was explained at the end of the preceding Sect. 2 in (I), its energetic effects are described by a Hamiltonian H m which is obtained by the adjoint action of the unitaries e iA(m ⊥ ) on the vacuum Hamiltonian H 0 . The function m ⊥ is in general no longer a test function because of the transverse projection. But it is still an element of the single particle space, so the unitary operators are well defined on the vacuum Fock space. In other words, the representation of the radiation field induced by the bi-localized charges is unitarily equivalent to the vacuum representation in Minkowski space. This changes, however, if the compensating charge is shifted away.</p><p>In order to approximate charged states in V + with a fixed charge distribution ϑ and to keep control of the energy of the radiation field, we move the compensating charge to light-like infinity by scaling σ , Their transverse parts m ⊥ ∞ induce representations of the radiation field which are charged, hence disjoint from the vacuum representation in Minkowski space. Still, the spacetime translations are implemented in these representations by unitary operators which satisfy the relativistic spectrum condition. For the proof we make use of a criterion by Roepstorff <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The crucial step is to demonstrate that the limit distributions m ⊥ ∞ can be restricted to positive light-like momenta and form elements of the space L ⊥ 1 (R 4 ) with (semi)norm given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">m ⊥ 2 1 := dp 1 + |p| 2 | m ⊥ (p)| 2 p 0 =|p| . (3.14)</formula><p>This space constitutes an extension of the massless single particle space L ⊥ 0 (R 4 ), where 1 is replaced by 0 in the square root in equation <ref type="bibr">(3.</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>14). It is shown in Appendix</head><formula xml:id="formula_18">A that | m ⊥ ∞ (p)| p 0 =|p| ≤ c k |p| −1−k , 0 &lt; k &lt; 1/4 . (3.15)</formula><p>The constants c k depend, apart from the choice of k within the above limitations, on the underlying test functions ϑ, σ . This estimate implies that m ⊥ ∞ ∈ L ⊥ 1 (R 4 ) and thus leads to the following statement. Let us briefly discuss at this point what information can be obtained in V + about the energy content of radiation fields which are created by perturbing the vacuum. Note that the Minkowskian Hamiltonian H 0 is not affiliated with the (weak closure of the) algebra V(V + ). Nevertheless, inertial observers can obtain some information by using the local stress energy tensor θ µν , which is a distribution-valued observable. Its integral over a Cauchy surface Σ ⊂ V + , e.g. a time shell, is formally given by Σ d Σ µ (x) θ µ 0 (x). Denoting by Ω the vacuum vector, one obtains for a dense set of local observables</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">A ∈ V(V + ) Ω, [ Σ d Σ µ (x) θ µ 0 (x), A]Ω = Ω, [H 0 , A]Ω = 0 . (3.16)</formula><p>This equation is valid since the integral extends only over a bounded region because of the space-like commutativity of observables. So it coincides with the integral over a locally deformed space-like hyper-plane in R 4 and hence with H 0 . By standard arguments this equation implies that one arrives at a densely defined, symmetric operator H Σ , putting</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">H Σ AΩ := [ Σ d Σ µ (x) θ µ 0 (x), A] Ω . (3.17)</formula><p>It coincides with the restriction of the vacuum Hamiltonian H 0 to that domain, which in fact is a core. Therefore, H 0 can be recovered in V + by subtracting from Σ d Σ µ (x) θ µ 0 (x) the contributions resulting from vacuum polarization effects. The integral by itself does not lead to a meaningful operator, however, due to infinite fluctuations.</p><p>Having seen that the creation of charged states produces radiation fields with decent energetic properties, we will show next that the states of these fields on light cone algebras are normal relative to the vacuum state. This means that the obstructions to normality considered possible in [6, Thm. 3.1] do not occur. Since the representations induced by the radiation fields are covariant with regard to spacetime translations, it suffices to establish normality on a single light cone algebra. Given m ∞ , we choose a light cone as follows. The underlying function m 1 in (3.8) is a test function with compact support. So there exists some positive time translation t such that this support is contained in the backward light cone V − + t. We prove normality of the radiation field on the corresponding forward light cone V + + t. This will be accomplished by making use of Huygens's principle. It implies that the restriction of the functional ϕ m∞ in equation (2.6) to test functions with support in V + + t does not change if one modifies m ∞ in the past cone V − + t. Taking advantage of this indeterminacy, we will see that the radiation data, which are accessible in V + + t, can be described by vectors in the Fock space of photons.</p><p>Our argument is based on the fact that charges with constant velocity do not radiate. We therefore return from m ∞ to the underlying gauge bridges between point charges, cf. <ref type="bibr">(3.4)</ref>. The underlying paths (3.3) in V + , restricted to the region V + \(V − + t), are then extended into V + ∪ (V − + t) in such a way that each of them approaches a light ray u → u l for large negative as well as positive u ∈ R. Radiation is caused by deviations from these light-like paths at intermediate times. For charges shifted asymptotically on a time shell in light-like directions, this radiation is moderate and will be determined. Integrating the resulting functions (3.4) for the extended paths with the test functions ϑ 0 , ϑ 1 , σ underlying m ∞ , cf. (3.8), one obtains a more regular function m reg with support in V + ∪ (V − + t).</p><p>It coincides with m ∞ on V + \(V − + t), hence (ϕ m∞ − ϕ mreg ) ↾ D 1 (V + + t) = 0. Moreover, as is shown in Appendix B, the transverse part of m reg is element of the one-photon space, m ⊥ reg ∈ L ⊥ 0 (R 4 ). As both, m ⊥ reg and m ⊥ ∞ , induce representations which are covariant with regard to the spacetime translations, the following result obtains. Proposition 3.2. Let ω m ⊥ ∞ be a state as in Proposition 3.1 and let ω m ⊥ reg be the associated state in Fock space, described in the preceding discussion. The restrictions of these states to the light cone algebra V(V + + t) coincide for some t ∈ V + . Whence, the restrictions are normal with regard to each other on all algebras V(V + + x), x ∈ R 4 . Thus, infrared clouds of photons cannot be detected in light cones.</p><p>We conclude this section by showing that the radiation field can be clearly distinguished from the other components of the electromagnetic field by measurements in V + . For the proof, we proceed from the three-vector-valued test functions f ∈ D D D 1 (V + ) having compact support in the (open) light-cone V + . The derived functions h := 0, −∆f + ∇(∇f ) are elements of C 1 (V + ) that lie in a subspace of wave functions in L ⊥ 0 (R 4 ) fixed by the chosen inertial system. In fact, they are dense in L ⊥ 0 (R 4 ). To prove this, note that the functions </p><formula xml:id="formula_21">x → h t (x) := h(x 0 − t, x) are elements of C 1 (V + ) for all t ≥ 0. So, by a double Laplace- transformation, ε → h ε := ∞ 0 ds ∞ 0 dt e −ε(s+t) h s+t , ε &gt; 0,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">p → h ε (p) = (p 0 − iε) −2 h(p) = (p 0 − iε) −2 0, p 2 f (p) − p (p f (p)) , ε &gt; 0 . (3.18)</formula><p>For lightlike momenta p 0 = |p| they converge in the one-photon space L ⊥ 0 (R 4 ) to f ⊥ in the limit of small ε. That they are dense in L ⊥ 0 (R 4 ) follows from the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. Moreover, in view of the decay properties of p → f (p) for large momenta, it is also clear that for m ⊥ ∞ ∈ L ⊥ 1 (R 4 ) the functions h ε → ϕ m∞ (h ε ) converge to ϕ m∞ (f ⊥ ) = ϕ m ⊥ ∞ (f ) on the test functions (3.18) in the limit of small ε. It implies that the transverse part of the electromagnetic field and the dispersion law of photons can be determined with great accuracy in bounded spatial regions by extended temporal measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>In this article, we have analyzed the impact of electric charges on the electromagnetic field that can be tested and perceived by real observers. In doing so, we have taken seriously the fact that experiments can only be performed in parts of Minkowski space, at best within future directed light cones. To simplify the analysis, we have made the assumption that the charges are external in nature, i.e. they act on the electromagnetic field, but there is no back-reaction. One can then consistently assume that the charges are compactly localizable. (In case of mutual interactions this is not possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.) Furthermore, the gauge bridges connecting the charges can be described by hypothetical particles with discrete mass zero (longitudinal photons). We believe that the findings obtained in the present analysis do not depend significantly on these idealizations. In particular, the remarkable qualitative differences between the theory restricted to light cones and the global Minkowskian theory appear to be of general validity.</p><p>First, the production of charged states from neutral bi-localized states in a light cone requires that one of the charges be moved to light-like infinity, i.e. into the space-like complement of the observers. This compensating charge must be brought to the speed of light, which can certainly only be achieved approximately in view of the energy required. Nevertheless, the energy of the electromagnetic field created by this operation is well defined and stays bounded below also in the limit, as we have shown. In Minkowski space, one frequently discusses that the compensating charge is moved to space-like infinity. This costs little if no energy. But this procedure is only possible in theory and can not be accomplished by real operations, not even approximately.</p><p>Second, we have seen that the notorious infrared clouds of massless particles predicted by Minkowskian theory in the presence of charges do not occur in light cones. All modes of the radiation field that can be resolved in light cones can be described by states in the Fock space of the photons. Since the Lorentz transformations are unitarily implemented in Fock space and light cone algebras are stable under their adjoint action, the restriction of the theory to a light cone induces a Lorentz-invariant infrared cutoff. In this manner, the infrared radiation is quenched geometrically.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that the longitudinal photons that give rise to Gauss's law in the gauge bridges between the charges can hardly be observed. Their starting points are the trajectories of the charges. From there they travel at the speed of light. They therefore disappear quickly in the space-like complement of inertial observers. This makes it impossible to determine their dispersion law with precision. Although they are particles with a discrete mass, they elude systematic observation and are virtual in this sense. Without engaging in speculation, it seems possible that such elusive particles are part of nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Appendix</head><p>Here we carry out the missing steps in the proof of Proposition 3.1.

The factor (1/u) can then be estimated by its value at the lower edge of the integration interval, determined by the test functions.

The remaining integrals can be estimated as in the preceding step, showing that the Cauchy-Euler derivative of ρ n satisfies a bound as in (A.9). This applies also to higher powers of the derivative by repeating this computation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">{x ∈ R 4 : x 0 &gt; 0, 0 &lt; τ 1 ≤ √ x 2 ≤ τ 2 , sR − r ≤ |x| ≤ sR + r} .

The bound 0(u −2 ) on the remainder is uniform for τ, x, y in the supports of ϑ 0 , ϑ 1 , and σ , respectively. Note that the division by |y| does not cause problems since the support of σ does not contain 0. We also note that the u-derivative of w τ,x,y has the asymptotic behavior resulting by differentiation of the terms in equation (B.2).</p><p>We proceed from these paths to corresponding counterparts in V − , putting for u ≤ 0 To merge these two functions, we modify the initial and final parts of the underlying paths. We restrict the u-integral in m ∞ to u ≥ 1 and that in m ∞ to u ≤ −1. The resulting truncated functions m t ∞ , m t ∞ differ from the corresponding original functions by test functions, cf. the remark after equation (3.9). To fill the gap between the truncated paths, we connect each final point w τ,x,y (−1) with the corresponding initial point w τ,x,y (1) by a straight line, = dτ dxdy ϑ 0 (τ )ϑ 1 (x)σ(y) e ipwτ,x,y(1) − e ipw τ,x,y (−1) /p(w τ,x,y (1) − w τ,x,y (−1)) (B.5)</p><p>is regular and bounded.

The intermediate function m i is square integrable according to the preceding observations.

We consider for given τ, x, y the continuous path u → z τ,x,y (u) consisting of the three pieces fixed by equations (B.3) for u ≤ −1, (B.4) for −1 ≤ u ≤ 1, and (B.1) for u ≥ 1. This path is smooth apart from the two contact points, where its derivative is discontinuous, though bounded. Plugging this path into equation <ref type="bibr">(3.4)</ref>, where the integral now extends over the entire real line, and proceeding to the Fourier transform, one obtains the distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">p → m zτ,x,y (p) := (2π) −2 ∞ −∞ duż τ,x,y (u) e ipzτ,x,y(u) . (B.7)</formula><p>Integrating it with the test functions ϑ 0 , ϑ 1 , and σ , one arrives at m reg . Its behavior for small momenta is determined by the singularities of m zτ,x,y . The leading singularity is due to the asymptotically light-like parts of z τ,x,y , i.e. u → l τ,x,y (u) := ul + r , cf. equation (B.2). As we will see, the transverse part of the resulting distribution vanishes. So this distribution does not contribute to the radiation field m ⊥ reg , in accordance with the fact that charges with constant velocity do not radiate. We may therefore subtract it from equation (B.7). The resulting difference is governed by the acceleration a in equation (B.2) that gives rise to a moderate logarithmic singularity if p becomes parallel to l τ,x,y . It implies that the restriction of the transverse function m ⊥ zτ,x,y to positive lightlike momenta is square integrable with regard to dp/|p| in a neighborhood of the origin.</p><p>Turning to the details, we replace in equation (B.7) the path z τ,x,y with l τ,x,y . It yields the distribution p → (2π) −1 δ(lp)e ipr l . Its restriction to light-like momenta vanishes unless p is parallel to l . Hence the projection onto its transverse component vanishes and we can therefore subtract this term from (B.7). To determine the effect of the acceleration a in (B.2), we consider the truncated paths u → a τ,x,y := ul + r + u −1 a for ±u ≥ 1. The difference between the corresponding distribution and the one for the light-like path is, for u ≥ 1, p → ∞ 1 du ȧ τ,x,y (u)e ipaτ,x,y(u) −l τ,x,y (u)e iplτ,x,y(u) , (B.8)</p><p>and a similar integral is obtained for u ≤ −1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Appendix</head><p>In this appendix we provide the proof of Lemma 4.1, which states that every state ω 0 β l on V V V with l ∈ L 1 (R 4 ) induces a representation in which the spacetime translations are unitarily implemented so that the relativistic spectrum condition holds. A similar result was obtained by Roepstorff <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> who considered the transverse radiation fields. Since we are also interested in the gauge bridges, we need to consider in addition the longitudinal components. Instead of adopting the strategy of Roepstorff for the proof, we outline here a slightly different argument that reveals the ingredients entering in this result.</p><p>We begin by noting that the GNS-representation of the algebra V V V induced by ω 0 β l can be realized in the vacuum representation induced by ω 0 . There it is given by the action of β l on the algebra V V V in the vacuum Hilbert space. If l is an element of the subspace L 0 (R 4 ) ⊂ L 1 (R 4 ), the corresponding β l is given by the adjoint action of the unitary operators e iA(l) . It follows that the unitary spacetime translations in this representation are given by, x ∈ R 4 , U l (x) = e iA(l) U 0 (x)e −iA(l) = e iA(l) e −iA(l(x)) U 0 (x) = e −(i/2) l,D l(x) e iA(l−l(x)) U 0 (x) . where • , • 0 is the scalar product in L 0 (R 4 ). Since small momenta in l are suppressed in the differences (l − l(x)) appearing in the last term of (C.1), one can extend this relation to all l ∈ L 1 (R 4 ), while retaining the properties of U l . We briefly sketch the argument.</p><p>Given any l ∈ L 1 (R 4 ), we approximate it by elements l ε ∈ L 0 (R 4 ), ε &gt; 0. Choosing a smooth function p → χ ε (p) which is equal to 0 for |p| ≤ ε and equal to 1 for |p| ≥ 2ε, these approximants are defined in momentum space by p → l ε (p) := χ ε (p) l(p). So l ε converges to l in L 1 (R 4 ) in the limit of small ε, hence β lε converges pointwise in norm to β l on the Weyl operators spanning V V V. The essential point is that (l ε − l ε (x)) converges strongly in L 0 (R 4 ), uniformly for x in compact sets C . This is apparent in momentum space and we omit the proof. It follows that the unitary Weyl operators e iA(lε−lε(x)) converge for small ε in the strong operator topology, uniformly on C . Similarly, one finds that the phases l ε , (l ε − l ε (x) converge. So the operators U lε (x) converge in the limit of small ε in the strong operator topology, uniformly for x ∈ C . Their limits define unitary operators U l (x), x ∈ R 4 . They form a continuous unitary representation of the spacetime translations which satisfies the relativistic spectrum condition. It also follows from the preceding discussion that their adjoint action generates the translations in the representation β l . This completes the proof of Lemma 4.1.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>x → σ s (x) := (1/s 3 ) σ(x/s) , s ≥ 1 . (3.12) These data, plugged into equation (3.8), yield test functions in D 1 (R 4 ) which are denoted by m s (they are obtained by extension of the u-integral from 1 to s). The space-like distance of the supports of the corresponding charge densities in equation (3.10) tends to infinity in the limit of large s, while the support of m s remains in a hypercone between the time shells τ 1 ≤ τ ≤ τ 2 , cf. [5, Appx.]. For the analysis of the properties of the radiation field in this limit, we consider the four-dimensional Fourier transform of the transverse component m ⊥ s of m s . Using time-shell coordinates, it is given by p → m ⊥ s (p) = ( m s − n(n m s ))(p) = dτ dx e i(p 0 √ τ 2 +x 2 −px) ϑ 0 (τ ) s 0 du dy ϑ 1 (x − uy) σ(y)(y − n(ny)) , (3.13) where n := p/|p|. It is shown in Appendix A that the restrictions of the functionals s → ϕ ms to test functions with support in V + , cf. (2.6), converge for large s. Their limits ϕ m∞ involve the distributions m ∞ which are obtained by extending the u-integral in (3.9) to infinity.</figDesc></figure>

Now, given any f ∈ D D D 1 (V + ) with support in O , its convolution with the commutator function, x → (Df )(x), is smooth and has support in the union of the forward and backward light-cones having their apex in O . Hence the function s → dx ∂ s m s (x)(Df )(x) vanishes for large s. This implies that s → s 0 du dx ∂ u m u (x)(Df )(x) = ϕ ms (f ) is constant for large s. It is proof of the statement that the functionals s → ϕ ms converge in the limit of large s on D D D 1 (V + ) to a functional ϕ m∞ . We also need estimates of the Cauchy-Euler derivative (x∇ x ) of ρ n on R 3 , (x∇ x )ρ n (x) = ∞ 0 du dy (x∇ x )ϑ 1 (x − uy) σ(y)(y − n(ny)) u) dy ϑ 1 (x − uy) ∂ y j σ(y) (y − n(ny)) + x − n(nx) ∞ 0 du (1/u) dy ϑ 1 (x − uy) σ(y) .

For any differentiable function ζ : R → C, one has D ζ(η n (τ, x)) = η n (τ, x) ζ ′ (η n (τ, x)), where ζ ′ denotes the derivative. Thus |p| 2 dτ dx e i|p|ηn(τ,x) ϑ 0 (τ )ρ n (x)= dτ dx (η n (τ, x) −1 D) 2 (1 − e i|p|ηn(τ,x) ) ϑ 0 (τ )ρ n (x) = dτ dx (D + 1)(D + 2) η n (τ, x) −2 (1 − e i|p|ηn(τ,x) ) ϑ 0 (τ )ρ n (x) = dτ dx η n (τ, x) −2 (1 − e i|p|ηn(τ,x) )(2 + D)(3 + D)ϑ 0 (τ )ρ n (x) . (A.11)The first two equalities arise by the action of D on functions of η n and the last equality obtains by partial integration, where D is converted toD T := −(∂ τ τ +(∇ x x)) = −(4+D). The resulting function τ, x → (2 + D)(3 + D)ϑ 0 (θ)ρ n (x)is a finite sum of products of Cauchy-Euler derivatives of ϑ 0 and ρ n . Thus the estimate (A.9) can be applied to all terms in this sum of integrals. By some abuse of notation, the corresponding integrands have the formτ, x → η n (τ, x) −2 (1 − e i|p|ηn(τ,x) )ϑ 0 (τ )ρ n (x) . (A.12) Picking l , 3/4 &lt; l &lt; 1, they are bounded by |η n (τ, x) −2 (1 − e i|p|ηn(τ,x) )ϑ 0 (τ )ρ n (x)| ≤ 2|p| l |η n (τ, x)| −2+l |ϑ 0 (τ )||ρ n (x)| . (A.13) Since |η n (τ, x)| −1 ≤ ( √ τ 2 + x 2 + |x|)/τ 2 and the τ -integration extends over the interval 0 &lt; τ 1 ≤ τ ≤ τ 2 , the upper bound is absolutely integrable with regard to τ, x if |x| ≤ 2r .

(B.3) Their leading asymptotic behavior for large negative u coincides with the right hand side of equation (B.2). Thus the deviation of both paths from a straight light-like line is due to the acceleration a, which causes radiation. Plugging w τ,x,y into equation (2.8), where the u-integral now extends over the negative reals, one obtains a function m ∞ that fits m ∞ and has support in V − . Since it is obtained from m ∞ merely by a reflection of time and the direction of paths, its Fourier transform has the same properties as those established for m ∞ in Sect. 3.</figDesc></figure>
